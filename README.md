# Battery-Optimization-Software
A simplistic Battery Sizing Tool, completed with the load data and energy prices that we where using for the project. Because of the size of the files containing the frequency data, only the first five days of January 2020 has been included. To acces all of the data that was used in the project, see: https://data.fingrid.fi/en/dataset/frequency-historical-data

All market data is fetched from SVK's Mimer service: https://mimer.svk.se/Start/, and bidding revenue is fetched from Nordpool https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/en/. 

This program is the open source code to "Simplistic Revenue Based BESS Sizing Tool Developed in Python Using Historical Grid Data" found on IEEE Explore and is written by (me) Lucas Tunelid, Micheal Peri, Srinath Sathyamoorthy, Hamza Shafique, Andres Rozas and Lina Bertling Tjernberg.
